(and it)htpc: these desktop computers mac minis android sticks load software stream video tv. these add content normal streaming box access, without giving quality recommended something comfortable technology mind fixing issues come time time.video game consoles: xbox/playstations access content streaming boxes plenty power deliver streams. the downside cost (unless already one) interfaces. these consoles designed stream video exclusively interfaces decent clunky.(you use options frankly worth hassle amount hair pulling would do.)now amazon product changed everything. it might box you...but honestly good chance should be. this brand new category amazon got lot right, shortcomings (at least launch) well read see are.amazon's fire tv boxpros:+ nothing else fast. while roku 3 impressed world, raises bar dramatically. with quad core processor 4 times memory streaming product, speeds menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker honestly muscle struggle higher end resolutions surround sound like boxes times. the best way i explain it, extra hours end year box that much faster.+ voice search amazing. it really works. less using four directional keypad enter titles real time saver makes wonder done amazon content vevo (music videos) (at least now). you use voice search netflix example.+ ready gaming, well least spend another 40. the 40 gaming controller feels bit pricy type gaming really 25 less opinion. that said, box real games would actually want play instead very limited selection roku 3 real console 100 honestly compared them.+ better image quality i know thinking i imagining things changed setup wife noticed generally (in different apps) video slightly sharper clearer. we using exact tv, settings, even hdmi cable used roku 3 switched fire tv box. we noticed especially poor quality feeds image quality noticeably better feeds roku 3. now i know better graphic chips bigger processor tweaking streaming seems something. as image quality huge deal folks (and normally us streamers suffer decent quality) certainly worth noting. so far noticed netflix, vevo plex.cons:- it lacks soul. yes, soul. the fire tv box remote built like dvd player appliance--cold, fast, efficient. unlike roku 3 box seems bit personally tivo--it feels warmer, inviting. everything box business like, including interface lack options change it.- the interface merely cold. it simply less flashy/pretty roku 3 interface. while fast, i less tempted wander around like i roku 3. it seems like pretty dependent voice search function great leaves missing random items find along way roku 3 interface. i update upon extended use.- the voice search works amazon's content (and vevo) 3rd party channels like netflix.- the remote ready gaming use, compared roku 3 remote gaming buttons turn remote sideways sensors detecting movements/motion.- another feature remote i care use bluetooth instead wifi. roku used use bluetooth former high end box instead replaced wifi increase battery life add headphone jack remote. it likely take weeks use report battery life concerned.- no headphone jack function like roku 3. now honest, use roku 3 battery drain cool feature.- missing popular channels launch. there hbo-go, m-go vudu. in addition, channel count much less roku's launch.- channels operate differently firetv roku 3. see notes information.overall:this fire tv box took much company's products missing items. they focused delivering smooth, fast performance less frills roku 3 price. while missing channels features, biggest failure personally cost gaming controller. without it, box ready gaming adding 40 ability try functionality seems pretty steep. had amazon included every fire tv box, would sold lot games everyone calling roku 3 poor value.if streaming box yet, i would highly recommend box every product market right now. i make endorsement lightly. i currently 3 roku 3 boxes i liked much, i used fire tv box. this box means roku really work improving product roku 4 lose high end market. (an update, wife officially asked replace roku 3 boxes fire tv boxes tonight. yes, things good folks)if roku 3 box, really look missing channels features--are something could give faster performance (also look notes features various common apps.) if answer yes, grab one try it. if no, wait see amazon adds features/channels. at least, consider fire tv box next box.i personally recommend apple tv still slow lack many features functions. apple keeps promising something amazing delivering minor improvements.if budget android based tablet, consider chromecast. it good value price give features content save cost compared roku 3 fire tv.i giving box 4.8 rating, compared 4.2 roku 3.i update review regularly while, check back information also questions comments, please feel free ask comments section. either helpful people best respond them.update 1:based comments, i wanted add points.regarding comments i received item free paid amazon write review, etc.i paid full list price local sales tax box (grrr). nothing provided i paid anything write device. i work amazon, i company. for item, i customer. in fact, i expect even purchase fire tv prior announced i figured would deal amazon's content i feel much weaker netflix. in fact, i talked two different family members getting netflix amazon's prime streaming service past month alone.hbo go:this repeated comments hbo go support something i interested i cable service anymore i feel hbo better value netflix. i would go without netflix support i personally think hbo go niche many people honestly i bet device get channel long. clearly hbo go people seem pushing issue i know 11 streaming box users none use hbo go i noted missing feature above, people still seem want beat it.update 2:channels:it needs said channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to channels) like hbo go (not currently box), showtime, espn, etc. even hbo, mean provider allows hbo go, look purchasing box mind. i like bloomberg tv (not available roku 3) app actually features live tv feature.netflix app: is older style tall covers (like vhs boxes) instead new netflix interface uses short wide covers (like roku 3). netflix said moving everything new software fire tv box yet. that makes comparing performance harder roku 3 fire tv. on isp provider comcast (netflix recently agreed pay comcast faster streams customers) i see huge improvement performance buffing like see channels. what seem start better quality and/or speed improvement quality. my guess netflix app needs tweaked maximize performance hardware. one positive firetv app plays entire tv episode before switching small window countdown starting next episode. i can't tell many times i click, click, click click see end episode roku 3.also, firetv netflix app two features removed updated roku app. before going tv show, firetv tells many total episodes netflix has. on roku shows number seasons instead. i personally prefer number episodes clearly personal preference. another point worth mentioning firetv netflix app shows many items list item number on. that information missing roku 3 netflix app.amazon prime content: does loop--a feature add (and likely will). this means get end, stops instead keeping going.voice search:voice search does cover 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting works amazon's content only. i repeated confirmed supports vevo app find music videos app. that may mean 3rd party apps covered well, certainly might able future. if search something prime content vevo content, default option options. to switch other, simply arrow either left right see music videos prime search results.optical out:i noticed box featured optical port normally run everything lg tv (via hdmi) use optical receiver (so i never change receiver's settings) i excited addition fire tv box roku 3 boxes. i stand corrected. i decided run audio via optical cable receiver directly fire tv box (something i roku 3) fixed random lip-sync issues i time time roku 3 box (and hdmi output box).now i know typical setup many people i know tons people lip-sync issues hdmi connections able bypass hdmi minefield much important i expected.vevo app:this app works better roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example content simply fails roku 3 app--try watching britney spears's work b**ch (don't make fun me). vevo play video fine youtube fire tv app struggles roku 3's app. some vevo's content also available via voice search too.remote:i miss jump back button remote roku 3 features. it tiny thing used jumping back see painting background catch line hear phone rang, someone talking, feel lost without it. update they include feature hid abit. you simply double click reward button skip back. i seen anyone else mention tip saw first peoplei like enter button back center directional keys. this way used roku boxes someone roku decided move directional keys, move thumb oddly press it.multitasking:what multitasking ask since seen advertised mentioned elsewhere, i understand confusion try this: load pandora stream...then click home button browse movies/tv want watch. as long home/amazon prime content, browse while pandora continues playing. now pandora dies enter another app like netflix shows multitasking built operating system may utilized future features. (again, tip found here)another update: this tip also works browsing plex content play something. so even utilizing 3rd party app, keep going. when changes new song, small window pops lower right hand side screen tell know new song title artist.plex app:compared roku app, plex firetv totally different. there cool features, like backgrounds, screensaver using photos much faster menuing (night day roku 3) i miss channels requiring couple clicks switch online see. i miss clicking play button play clip, instead select (click) play (second click).screensaver:firetv screensaver honestly pretty cool opinion. i saying can't boxes box comes set display random photos (and includes decent amount beautiful photos well.) this functionality covers 3rd party apps like netflix plex seamless slideshow matter using starts. this sort thing see pcs streaming boxes nice touch.game changing:many commenters argued device gaming changing many rating review helpful title.i said nothing else fast one commenter said, nobody cares fast streaming box is. that's game changeractually using see i mean. this first time company put much creating solidly made hardware device. like fast computer (which basically is), depend software written fully show abilities.when amd created first processor competed directly intel's higher end processors, game changer, correct, changed landscape personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc.people look back 5 years moment say amazon's firetv changed consumer streaming video boxes made (instead barely enough processing power stream, became able compete htpcs mac minis). this beginning new generation streaming boxes.i said voice search amazing. said not unique, means. my xbox, ps3, tablets, this, work amazingly.find one person owns say voice search works better anything google, apple microsoft. the fact little old amazon could deliver tech giants shocking. the fact works via tiny remote makes easy get use to. there product price range streaming box even offers cost.i said ready gaming, well least spend another 40 said: and stick basic android games. no thanks. i real console (or couple them) play real games...this meant compete expensive game consoles. it meant bring gaming streaming boxes, like tablets/cellphones brought gaming millions. they replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) like box ditch gaming console either instead opens tons games can't play console. just imagine cheap 5/free games enjoy firetv box. as i said main review, i think amazon really thrown controller really get peopling playing games i understand needed limit losses.again, best class hardware device real gaming best voice search tech device (and one streaming video box). every future streaming box measured one. tell game changingplease understand everyone different priorities requirements one box going perfect everyone. i attempting best address many options provide decently balanced opinion them.hopefully review helpful you. if so, please let know clicking button below. remember agree everything i said think helpful ) read","['casual', 'user', 'demand', 'content', 'device', 'tried', 'smart', 'tv', 'brand',

really tell difference new hd fire. if first-time tablet buyer, price vs. value key consideration, looking affordable tablet kids, i'd recommend regular kindle fire hd 139. if comparing last year's hd model version operating fine, i'd say save money continue get money's worth one.my review compares lot features version fire hdx original fire hd well year's model fire hd, also features first-time user.consistent experience setup year's model kindle fire hd, setup took long time: despite brand new product, fire hdx attempted download install several operating software updates. software updates kindle usually background, annoying watching crashes manual reboots. consistent fire hd, crashed setup, playing song, watching tv show, reading book. it took little hour get thing running without consistent crashes final software update worked expected without issues.screen display / video playback:this version fire absolute best screen display fire model date. looking technical specs amazon made major changes display / resolution, picture appears crisp: i compared viewing experience watching standard test fire devices past couple years - laugh - first episode wonder woman tv series 70's. the display fire one heck lot better terms sharpness last year's model well year's model fire hd. for technical folks there, display 1,920 x 1,200 50 pixels per inch fire hd.wi-fi connectivity:the initial wi-fi setup took time remember password router software update / crash / reboot series. after final operating software update i mentioned above, however, fairly easy connect internet via wi-fi.my standard test trying new gadgets see fast run side-by-side known piece equipment test best place wi-fi house worst place drags. in comparison, i hdx version fire sitting next last year's year's version hd fire, well last year's 8.9 hd fire, motorola razr smartphone, ipad 2 (yes, kindle guy uses ipad work), first-generation 7 fire (the model two years ago) using wi-fi connection vs. cellular connectivity.my normal website test hit mobile websites foxnews, cnn, personalized yahoo page, google, houston chronicle. the ones usually slow devices faster hdx (houston chronicle cnn), sites i tell difference speed location closest router. when i went slowest / worst reception location house, speed noticeable difference devices one little bit faster last year's model 7 kindle fire hd yes, also faster year's model fire hd i attribute increase speed dual antennas hdx.sound / music playback:the two speakers located back kindle fire two not-noticeable ports: one top one bottom. my test feature cranking van halen's panama maximum volume (i always want see could really play guitar licks), i would alternate covering one speaker other: true stereo sound degradation sound makes think blow speaker. the dolby speakers sound nice get hear bass. however, i still opinion speakers going well placed back i front: i want able hear whatever i listening without really crank disturbing someone else room (that's happens start losing hearing like i am). while cover version shipped yet - covers released time - i imagine sound quality might decrease cover back speakers. the x-ray feature pretty neat displays lyrics screen inclined not, simple tap icon make lyric feature go away.email setup:consistent previous versions fire, email setup easy main gmail account, software came fire primary use existing app called enhanced email i purchased amazon app store. i setup email app came program problem - took minute setup main google account - i able send receive emails well synch online calendar via google's calendar contacts. for asking i using enhanced email program, simple answer like many i one email account: quickly switch back forth accounts tool. the lazy person appreciates i like getting lazy chair i'm settled in!new tabs screen layout:in addition normal tabs amazon continued make tweaks look feel overall display things scroll find looking easier manner. interestingly, consistent experiences year's model fire hd, i purchased one special offers ad i seen far main screen saver vs. overwhelmed ads like last year's model.reading books:turning pages pretty darn easy - tap side screen go next page back page, swipe finger across screen same. amazon add feature see book's description books device like e-ink kindle (always annoyance last year's model), plus i can't remember book digital to-be-read pile getting book description, requires several taps screen eventually get want be. if easier way it, i can't find maybe i one first guys, ever, crack open electronic user's manual figure (doubt it). for wondered, still can't organize books categories unless purchase third-party app/a amazon app store.bluetooththere bluetooth connection, i usual test feature taking car fire stream music car stereo. there delays skips connection, paired minute. just make sure give device name recognize recognized.camera:there camera model - faces front toward user / reader. focusing taking picture pretty easy, amazon default store pictures cloud - counts storage allotment. i'd recommend turning automatic storage feature unless sure want it, go limit provide amazon another opportunity collect monthly revenue stream you.charger:unlike previous models fire, one does include charger! if scratching head comment, previous models purchase charger separately 20 always seemed kind silly amazon do.mayday button:a new feature model, included year's regular model fire, introduction mayday button. basically, touch button video screen pop actually see - talk - live customer service agent. i pressed button yet try out, i think i would feel pretty dumb: ask help, i want say i wanted see works stopped say hi' purposes review.what i wish had: case ready go shipped fire ready (why waiting). a case important order protect investment. also, i'm interested see try hurt speaker's performance i mentioned due speakers back unit hopefully covered case.overall, 229 16gb memory model (309 64 gb memory) i think good deal someone really uses video / apps feature. kids love read books, play games, watch tv movies, whole lot things. adults like exact reasons, i try minimize amount work-related stuff i home business apps available amazon app store places around internet i also work excel word-compatible files i without fire work laptop whatever case may be. if never owned tablet before, looking upgrade earlier model fire, i would recommend one video apps thing - make sure purchase higher memory one vs. minimum 16 gb. if comparing last year's hd model version operating fine, looking tablet younger children, i'd say save money continue get money's worth last year's model get year's model kindle fire hd 139. read","['sum', 'tell', 'detail',

factor possible side-load apps google play store onto amazon tablet web search side-loading apps onto kindle fire show dozens websites detailed instructions. if app sideloading requires google service

download prime instant videos. i verified i download prime instant videos kindle fire hdx. however, option available movies tv shows. it looks like get permission studios said yes. so, example, i able download casablanca able download the avengers even though part prime instant video collection available free streaming.update: adding bit reply comments: amazon clearly looking enterprise market launch, least based details provide. they've added full accessibility support (required order get government contracts), bringing support vpn business printing, better email client tighter integration exchange, including officesuite productivity. there productivity tools available app store, well, although google apple, particularly latter, options. when vpn support arrives, i'll definitely taking look, would nice lug laptop home every night.so kindle fire hdx differ previous generation kindle fire hddisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). it's that, though, colors richer, brighter, better contrast. this display judged many reviewers best class i would agree. amazon also added technology automatically adjust contrast brightness viewing tablet bright sunlight. while definitely noticeable improvement, need reading beach. for that, need eink reader like kindle paperwhite.sound: as far i tell, sound same. this already one best-sounding tablets market, dolby stereo output enough power actually make possible listen music video without requiring headphones.size weight: noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). this comfortable tablet hold one-handed, even long periods time.processor: it's *lot* faster (2.2ghz quad-core, top-of-the-line cpu, compared 1.2ghz dual-core). this tablet amazingly fast smooth, fastest processor class. every game i've tried run smoothly, hesitations, slowdowns, glitches. scrolling content amazingly smooth fast now, without hesitations occasional slowdowns previous generations.build: a redesigned shell power volume control buttons easy find! this solid build back shell something fingerprint magnet. since us buying case put tablet in, may issue.camera: if difference last year's camera year's, i'm able see it. it's high-def camera suitable video-conferencing skype. like last year's model, rear camera. if important you, need 8.9 version.hdmi output: this one area last year's model wins. amazon removed hdmi connector tablet line (but see description details amazon providing software solution sharing tablet screen television). no tablet i'm aware functionality something need, able purchase one last year's models fairly cheaply.battery life: the same, 11 hours. however, amazon added special reading mode device, claim extend battery life much 17 hours. i test this. for personal use, battery life adequate.price: it's expensive (229 vs. 199) year include power adapter, 20 extra last year, actual difference price 10. for getting, price increase definitely justified.it updated os updated feature software (including free unlimited mayday customer support feature). the software updates include ability download prime instant videos device watch offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls features (so better suited office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved x-ray features (now including lyrics music, well additional information books movies), integration goodreads (coming soon), like.where i noticed biggest difference home screen. the default view still carousel swipe upward, see traditional icon view. the recommended display home screen smaller much less obtrusive (and turned settings). amazon also added multi-tasking sort, swiping bottom screen app shows 20 most-recently-used items home screen, quickly switch one app another without returning home screen.there also left panel available screens (but home screen) apps, navigation links settings make easier navigate control tablet navigate within app. if tap center display swipe left reading book, example, see panel shows table contents, about author link, sync furthest page read link, on.the kindle freetime option parental controls still among best business. if want tablet child want control access, long use tablet given time, like, amazon covered.you also schedule quiet time tablet, notification sounds pop-up notifications disabled, either temporary basis simply pushing button scheduled basis. frankly, i doubt i'll ever use feature type likes read watch video fall asleep, kind nice able disable sounds get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays new word words friends game.mayday: this huge gamble amazon interesting see whether pays off. this feature techie like i use (although i sorely tempted). from commercials, pretty amazing, particularly get live chat matter minute less (amazon's goal something like 15 seconds, i believe, although i can't help wondering happen christmas day!). if thinking getting tablet technophobe, addition feature may make kindle fire hdx best choice.how tablet rank competition there really two tablets class currently: google nexus 7 just-announced apple ipad mini retina display.display: all three devices retina displays, 7 hdx nexus 1920x1200 (323 ppi) 8 ipad mini 2048x1536 (326 ppi). all three displays stunning. amazon claims enhanced ability read display bright sunlight, something that's problem devices. while first choice read pool (i'd pick paperwhite), i testify easier view display bright sunlight predecessors.it's worth noting aspect ratio hdx nexus 16:10 aspect ratio ipad mini 4:3. where matters watching video. if watching old television show, 4:3 aspect ratio fine. if watching high-def movie, 4:3 aspect ratio going leave large black bars screen video much compressed would hdx nexus. apple chose maintain backward compatibility prior devices rather moving up.sound: the hdx dolby digital surround sound nexus frauenhofer surround sound ipad mini stereo sound. the ipad mini also makes mistake amazon made first-generation tablet: putting speakers side (in case, bottom tablet). if watching video, tablet turned sideways sound come side. the hdx, contrast, speakers placed perfectly video watching.networking: the hdx ipad mini dual band, dual antenna (mimo) wi-fi. the nexus dual band dual antenna. all things equal, i would expect nexus lag bit behind others networking performance, particularly areas connection spotty.size weight:hdx: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 10.7 oz.nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 10.24 oz.ipad mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 11.68 oz.there's really nothing choose here. all three small, thin, light. the ipad mini heaviest also slightly larger screen.processor:hdx: 2.2 ghz quad-core snapdragon 800 processor, 2gb memorynexus: 1.5ghz quad-core snapdragon s4 pro, 2gb memoryipad mini: 64-bit dual-core a7, 1gb memorythe hdx ipad come ahead nexus processing power hdx nexus come ahead ipad mini memory. the a7 dual-core processor according tech sites run benchmarks, definitely holds quad-core snapdragon. these pretty powerful tablets.cameras: both nexus ipad mini 1.2 mp front 5mp rear cameras. the hdx front-facing camera. if expect take pictures tablet, hdx you.battery life: hdx 11 hours (17 hours reading) nexus 9 hours ipad mini 10 hours. amazon wins one, particularly spending lot time reading.expansion: none microsd slot assume using respective cloud systems.parental controls: all basic parental controls allow limit child's access content, purchases, web, on. amazon goes farther, though, kindle free time kindle free time unlimited options, latter inexpensive subscription curated library content. if buying first tablet child, i'd choose kindle fire hd. at 139, significantly cheaper options hdx has.enterprise: as soon amazon releases update, add vpn network printing support. i believe tablets basic enterprise capabilities, including support various office apps. for real productivity, though, personally i'd go laptop, tablet.support: amazon wins category, hands down, new mayday system. apple comes second, apple amazon usually taking top marks customer support survey. this area google shine.price: the hdx nexus win one, hands down. both priced 229 vs. 399 new ipad mini. neither google amazon makes much, any, money tablets they're counting purchase content respective stores.from perspective, single clear winner, tablet strengths weaknesses. if already amazon prime, hdx no-brainer, access prime instant video kindle owners' lending library. if primarily buying tablet read with, amazon wins there, well, 17-hour battery life reading best display reading outdoors. if want apps, apple google far choices. if want watch movies, i'd pick either hdx nexus, apple's aspect ratio lagging sound put back pack. if price factor, pick either hdx nexus.if heavily invested apple ecosystem, i.e., already iphone ipad content itunes, hdx really tablet you. similarly, love browsing google play apps play samsung galaxy phone, likely disappointed section available amazon (although, i note above, google play apps sideloaded onto tablet). if love google now siri, neither ever available amazon, tablet you.the bottom line: this tablet primarily intended viewport amazon content amazon services. if amazon prime amazon ebooks collection, tablet no-brainer. the price low, particularly get, small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet stunning display superb sound. this really one top tablets class.note: as others noted, tablet update software first turn connect wifi. unlike others, i trouble operation, glitches crashes. it took several minutes process ran smoothly, tablet everything done.update:now i kindle fire hd kindle fire hdx tablet, i'm little better position talk one i'd recommend:you get kindle fire hdx if:- you're techie wants latest greatest, best display, fastest processor.- you need camera skype video app.- you play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- the size weight matter you, even small increments this.- you think need mayday technical support.you get kindle fire hd if:- price factor. 90 cheaper insignificant amount. this really excellent value money.- you want inexpensive tablet child (and, case, lack camera might well plus)- all want basic tablet reading books, playing music, watching occasional video, playing words friends, like. while screen hd stunning hdx, still true hd screen good.i check back pretty regularly, question, please feel free ask i'll best answer it.

year: kindle fire hd, kindle fire hdx (this tablet), kindle fire hdx 8.9. this successor last year's kindle fire hd updated operating system new features, redesigned shell (with power volume control buttons readily accessible), absolutely amazing display, superb sound, included power adapter, new mayday feature. see http://www.amazon.com/review/rnh700dom9wn3/ review kindle fire hd http://www.amazon.com/review/r2ypithvtylczt review kindle fire hdx 8.9.update: some users reporting bluish glow around edges screen hdx. if search youtube hdx blue haze, find video showing issue. amazon updated learn more link following info:to achieve perfect color accuracy kindle fire hdx 7 lowest possible battery consumption device weight, used blue, white, leds. blue leds allow much accurate rich representation color result 20 improvement power efficiency.as result using blue leds, may notice narrow, faint blue tint around edge device looking items white background, books web pages. all displays level light emission around edges, light kindle fire hdx 7 blue due technology used render perfect color accuracy.if something think would bother you, i'd recommend taking look youtube video taking look hdx local best buy office superstore. i've also uploaded user image hdx book loaded see blue glow (http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/b00dopno4m/).the amazon tablets primarily content consumption devices, best suited connecting amazon ecosystem, including videos, music, books, apps, on. with free prime trial subscription, check prime instant video options watch movies shows charge 30 days. for videos, music, books, amazon selection near top list apps, much less so. 90 top 100 apps available amazon.com, well 100,000 others, that's small fraction available google apple.it's quite bad sounds because, competition ten times many apps, apps are, um ... shall i put ... less stellar (look sturgeon's law). if specific apps need want, definitely double-check purchasing make sure available. the apps likely never become available kindle fire ecosystem apps require google services (i.e., anything uses google location services). one ameloriating factor possible side-load apps google play store onto amazon tablet web search side-loading apps onto kindle fire show dozens websites detailed instructions. if app sideloading requires google service work, though, run fire, even manage successfully install it.like kindle fire tablets, well apple ipad google nexus, kindle tablet line micro-sd slot, assumption consuming content cloud. this fine using tablet wifi good traveling want load tablet content trip. if latter something expect regularly, might want consider 32gb 64gb versions, pay additional price 4g version, available 7 tablet first time. also, content itunes google play, would side-load everything onto tablet. as true apple google tablets, there's way automatically connect cloud storage competition.something new year ability download prime instant videos. i verified i download prime instant videos kindle fire hdx. however, option available movies tv shows. it looks like get permission studios said yes. so, example, i able download casablanca able download the avengers even though part prime instant video collection available free streaming.update: adding bit reply comments: amazon clearly looking enterprise market launch, least based details provide. they've added full accessibility support (required order get government contracts), bringing support vpn business printing, better email client tighter integration exchange, including officesuite productivity. there productivity tools available app store, well, although google apple, particularly latter, options. when vpn support arrives, i'll definitely taking look, would nice lug laptop home every night.so kindle fire hdx differ previous generation kindle fire hddisplay: 1920x1200 (323 ppi) vs 1280x800 (216 ppi). it's that, though, colors richer, brighter, better contrast. this display judged many reviewers best class i would agree. amazon also added technology automatically adjust contrast brightness viewing tablet bright sunlight. while definitely noticeable improvement, need reading beach. for that, need eink reader like kindle paperwhite.sound: as far i tell, sound same. this already one best-sounding tablets market, dolby stereo output enough power actually make possible listen music video without requiring headphones.size weight: noticeably lighter (10.7 oz vs. 13.9 oz) noticeably smaller (7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 vs. 7.6 x 5.4 x 0.4). this comfortable tablet hold one-handed, even long periods time.processor: it's *lot* faster (2.2ghz quad-core, top-of-the-line cpu, compared 1.2ghz dual-core). this tablet amazingly fast smooth, fastest processor class. every game i've tried run smoothly, hesitations, slowdowns, glitches. scrolling content amazingly smooth fast now, without hesitations occasional slowdowns previous generations.build: a redesigned shell power volume control buttons easy find this solid build back shell something fingerprint magnet. since us buying case put tablet in, may issue.camera: if difference last year's camera year's, i'm able see it. it's high-def camera suitable video-conferencing skype. like last year's model, rear camera. if important you, need 8.9 version.hdmi output: this one area last year's model wins. amazon removed hdmi connector tablet line (but see description details amazon providing software solution sharing tablet screen television). no tablet i'm aware functionality something need, able purchase one last year's models fairly cheaply.battery life: the same, 11 hours. however, amazon added special reading mode device, claim extend battery life much 17 hours. i test this. for personal use, battery life adequate.price: it's expensive (229 vs. 199) year include power adapter, 20 extra last year, actual difference price 10. for getting, price increase definitely justified.it updated os updated feature software (including free unlimited mayday customer support feature). the software updates include ability download prime instant videos device watch offline, enhanced accessibility, enhanced enterprise controls features (so better suited office work), enhanced email client, enhanced parental controls, improved x-ray features (now including lyrics music, well additional information books movies), integration goodreads (coming soon), like.where i noticed biggest difference home screen. the default view still carousel swipe upward, see traditional icon view. the recommended display home screen smaller much less obtrusive (and turned settings). amazon also added multi-tasking sort, swiping bottom screen app shows 20 most-recently-used items home screen, quickly switch one app another without returning home screen.there also left panel available screens (but home screen) apps, navigation links settings make easier navigate control tablet navigate within app. if tap center display swipe left reading book, example, see panel shows table contents, about author link, sync furthest page read link, on.the kindle freetime option parental controls still among best business. if want tablet child want control access, long use tablet given time, like, amazon covered.you also schedule quiet time tablet, notification sounds pop-up notifications disabled, either temporary basis simply pushing button scheduled basis. frankly, i doubt i'll ever use feature type likes read watch video fall asleep, kind nice able disable sounds get rudely awakened when, e.g., someone plays new word words friends game.mayday: this huge gamble amazon interesting see whether pays off. this feature techie like i use (although i sorely tempted). from commercials, pretty amazing, particularly get live chat matter minute less (amazon's goal something like 15 seconds, i believe, although i can't help wondering happen christmas day). if thinking getting tablet technophobe, addition feature may make kindle fire hdx best choice.how tablet rank competition there really two tablets class currently: google nexus 7 just-announced apple ipad mini retina display.display: all three devices retina displays, 7 hdx nexus 1920x1200 (323 ppi) 8 ipad mini 2048x1536 (326 ppi). all three displays stunning. amazon claims enhanced ability read display bright sunlight, something that's problem devices. while first choice read pool (i'd pick paperwhite), i testify easier view display bright sunlight predecessors.it's worth noting aspect ratio hdx nexus 16:10 aspect ratio ipad mini 4:3. where matters watching video. if watching old television show, 4:3 aspect ratio fine. if watching high-def movie, 4:3 aspect ratio going leave large black bars screen video much compressed would hdx nexus. apple chose maintain backward compatibility prior devices rather moving up.sound: the hdx dolby digital surround sound nexus frauenhofer surround sound ipad mini stereo sound. the ipad mini also makes mistake amazon made first-generation tablet: putting speakers side (in case, bottom tablet). if watching video, tablet turned sideways sound come side. the hdx, contrast, speakers placed perfectly video watching.networking: the hdx ipad mini dual band, dual antenna (mimo) wi-fi. the nexus dual band dual antenna. all things equal, i would expect nexus lag bit behind others networking performance, particularly areas connection spotty.size weight:hdx: 7.3 x 5.0 x 0.35 10.7 oz.nexus: 7.9 x 4.5 x 0.34 10.24 oz.ipad mini: 7.87 x 5.3 x 0.29 11.68 oz.there's really nothing choose here. all three small, thin, light. the ipad mini heaviest also slightly larger screen.processor:hdx: 2.2 ghz quad-core snapdragon 800 processor, 2gb memorynexus: 1.5ghz quad-core snapdragon s4 pro, 2gb memoryipad mini: 64-bit dual-core a7, 1gb memorythe hdx ipad come ahead nexus processing power hdx nexus come ahead ipad mini memory. the a7 dual-core processor according tech sites run benchmarks, definitely holds quad-core snapdragon. these pretty powerful tablets.cameras: both nexus ipad mini 1.2 mp front 5mp rear cameras. the hdx front-facing camera. if expect take pictures tablet, hdx you.battery life: hdx 11 hours (17 hours reading) nexus 9 hours ipad mini 10 hours. amazon wins one, particularly spending lot time reading.expansion: none microsd slot assume using respective cloud systems.parental controls: all basic parental controls allow limit child's access content, purchases, web, on. amazon goes farther, though, kindle free time kindle free time unlimited options, latter inexpensive subscription curated library content. if buying first tablet child, i'd choose kindle fire hd. at 139, significantly cheaper options hdx has.enterprise: as soon amazon releases update, add vpn network printing support. i believe tablets basic enterprise capabilities, including support various office apps. for real productivity, though, personally i'd go laptop, tablet.support: amazon wins category, hands down, new mayday system. apple comes second, apple amazon usually taking top marks customer support survey. this area google shine.price: the hdx nexus win one, hands down. both priced 229 vs. 399 new ipad mini. neither google amazon makes much, any, money tablets they're counting purchase content respective stores.from perspective, single clear winner, tablet strengths weaknesses. if already amazon prime, hdx no-brainer, access prime instant video kindle owners' lending library. if primarily buying tablet read with, amazon wins there, well, 17-hour battery life reading best display reading outdoors. if want apps, apple google far choices. if want watch movies, i'd pick either hdx nexus, apple's aspect ratio lagging sound put back pack. if price factor, pick either hdx nexus.if heavily invested apple ecosystem, i.e., already iphone ipad content itunes, hdx really tablet you. similarly, love browsing google play apps play samsung galaxy phone, likely disappointed section available amazon (although, i note above, google play apps sideloaded onto tablet). if love google now siri, neither ever available amazon, tablet you.the bottom line: this tablet primarily intended viewport amazon content amazon services. if amazon prime amazon ebooks collection, tablet no-brainer. the price low, particularly get, small, light, high-quality, high-powered, tablet stunning display superb sound. this really one top tablets class.note: as others noted, tablet update software first turn connect wifi. unlike others, i trouble operation, glitches crashes. it took several minutes process ran smoothly, tablet everything done.update:now i kindle fire hd kindle fire hdx tablet, i'm little better position talk one i'd recommend:you get kindle fire hdx if:- you're techie wants latest greatest, best display, fastest processor.- you need camera skype video app.- you play graphics-intensive games (e.g., racing games).- the size weight matter you, even small increments this.- you think need mayday technical support.you get kindle fire hd if:- price factor. 90 cheaper insignificant amount. this really excellent value money.- you want inexpensive tablet child (and, case, lack camera might well plus)- all want basic tablet reading books, playing music, watching
