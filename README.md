## Data Science Algorithms Repository
### This repository contains implementations of various data science algorithms in Python. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script for easy understanding and integration into your projects.

## Algorithms Included:
### 1. Association Rules: 
Implementations of algorithms like Apriori for association rule mining.

### 2. Clustering: 
Implementation of clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.

### 3. Decision Tree:
Implementation of decision tree algorithms like C5.0, and CART for classification tasks.

### 4. Forecasting:
Implementations of time series forecasting algorithms including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and LSTM.

### 5. Hypothesis Testing:
Implementations of statistical tests like t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, etc., for hypothesis testing.

### 6. Linear Regression:
Implementation of simple and multiple linear regression models for predicting continuous outcomes.

### 7. Logistic Regression:
Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification tasks.

### 8. Naive Bayes:
Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier for classification tasks based on Bayes' theorem.

### 9. Random Forest:
Implementation of the random forest ensemble learning algorithm for classification tasks.

### 10. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

### 11. Recommendation System:
Implementations of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation systems.

### 12. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Implementation of SVM for classification tasks with linear and nonlinear kernels.

### 13. Statistics:
Implementation of statistical algorithms for descriptive and inferential statistics.

### 14. Text Mining:
Implementations of algorithms for text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.

### 15. Neural Network:
Implementation of neural network architectures including feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks.

### Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script. You can simply clone this repository and run the scripts individually. Make sure you have the required libraries installed by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
